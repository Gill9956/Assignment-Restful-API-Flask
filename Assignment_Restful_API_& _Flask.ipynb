    "\n",
    "#### Answer 1:\n",
    " A RESTful API is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses HTTP requests to access and manipulate data, following principles like statelessness, client-server architecture, and using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). It operates on resources, with each resource identified by a URL, and the operations on them are represented by HTTP methods.\n",
